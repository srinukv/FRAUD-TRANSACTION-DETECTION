# Business Fraud Detection 
This case requires trainees to develop a model for predicting fraudulent transactions for a financial company and use insights from the model to develop an actionable plan. Data for the case is available in CSV format having 6362620 rows and 10 columns. Candidates can use whatever method they wish to develop their machine learning model. Following usual model development procedures, the model would be estimated on the calibration data and tested on the validation data. This case requires both statistical analysis and creativity/judgment. We recommend you spend time on both fine-tuning and interpreting the results of your machine learning model.

# Fraud Transaction Controller

A robust system designed to detect, monitor, and prevent fraudulent transactions in real time. This project leverages rule‑based checks, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques to assess transaction risk, reduce false positives, and ensure financial security.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The **Fraud Transaction Controller** project is built to:
- **Monitor Transactions:** Continuously process transaction data for signs of fraudulent activity.
- **Analyze Patterns:** Use a combination of rule‑based logic and machine learning to identify suspicious behavior.
- **Prevent Fraud:** Automatically flag or block transactions that exceed predefined risk thresholds.
- **Alert & Report:** Generate alerts and detailed reports for further investigation by fraud analysts.

This tool is ideal for financial institutions, e‑commerce platforms, and any organization needing an extra layer of security against fraud.

---

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Analyze incoming transactions on the fly.
- **Customizable Rules Engine:** Define risk thresholds, rules, and escalation paths.
- **Machine Learning Detection:** Incorporate supervised/unsupervised models to detect emerging fraudulent patterns.
- **Scalability:** Designed to integrate with high-volume transaction systems.
- **Alert Mechanism:** Notify stakeholders via email or API integration when fraud is detected.
- **Detailed Logging & Reporting:** Audit trail for all transactions and actions taken.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python (or your chosen language)
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Flask/Django for API endpoints, scikit-learn for machine learning models, Pandas for data manipulation
- **Database:** PostgreSQL/MySQL (or as applicable) for storing transaction logs and rules
- **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ/Kafka for real-time processing (optional)
- **Containerization:** Docker for deployment and scalability

📊 Usage
Monitoring Transactions: Configure your data pipeline to feed live transaction data into the system.

Defining Rules: Modify rule definitions and risk thresholds in the configuration files located in the src/config/ directory.

Interacting with the API: Use the provided API endpoints to:

Submit transactions for evaluation

Retrieve risk scores and alerts

Generate detailed reports for flagged transactions

💡 Design & Architecture
Modular Design: The application separates data ingestion, analysis logic, and API management for better maintainability.

Scalable Architecture: Designed to horizontally scale using Docker and Kubernetes.

Integrations: Easily integrates with third-party fraud databases and external risk scoring APIs.
